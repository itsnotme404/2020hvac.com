	  <h3>Heating Systems:</h3>
	  <h5> Central Air Furnaces</h5>
      <p>Central air furnaces are designed to heat your entire home by distributing warm air through air ducts. They are usually installed in utility closets, basements or attics as they require adequate space for installation/ maintenance and proper ventilation. The most common furnaces we install are powered by natural gas* or electricity.</p>
		<img style="padding-bottom:30px;" class="w3-image w3-round-large" src="images/centralFurnace.jpg" alt="Add pictures" width="700" height="394">
      </div>
	  
	  <div  style="width:100%; padding:30px;" class="w3-col m6">
	  <h5>Wall Furnaces</h5>
	  <p>Wall furnaces (also known as wall heaters) are compact units designed to heat specific rooms/areas in your home. They are installed directly on a wall and require some space to allow for proper ventilation. We commonly install wall furnaces powered by natural gas* or electricity. We offer both single-sided units (heats one room/area) or double-sided units (heats two adjacent rooms/areas).</p>
		<img style="padding-bottom:30px;" class="w3-image w3-round-large" src="images/wallFurnace.jpg" alt="Add pictures" width="700" height="394">
      </div>
	  
	  <div  style="width:100%; padding:30px;" class="w3-col m6">
	  <h3> Cooling Systems:</h3>
	  <h5> Central Air Conditioners</h5>
	  <p>Central air conditioners are designed to cool your entire home by distributing cold air through air ducts. These systems have an inside unit (installed alongside your furnace) and outside unit. The inside unit pulls warm air from your home while the outside unit uses refrigerant to pump cool air back into your home. The most common central air conditioners we install are powered by electricity.</p>
		<img style="padding-bottom:30px;" class="w3-image w3-round-large" src="images/centralAC.jpg" alt="Add pictures" width="700" height="394">
      </div>
	  
	  <div  style="width:100%; padding:30px;" class="w3-col m6">
	  <h5>Through-the-Wall Air Conditioners</h5>
	  <p>Through-the-wall air conditioners are compact units designed to cool specific rooms/areas in your home. Like their name implies, these units are installed inside your home through to an exterior wall. These systems are comprised of an indoor evaporator unit and an outdoor condenser unit with a wall sleeve in between to insulate your home. These systems are powered by electricity and function more efficiently than window-mounted A/C's.</p>
		<img style="padding-bottom:30px;" class="w3-image w3-round-large" src="images/wallAC.jpg" alt="Add pictures" width="700" height="394">
      </div>
	  
	  <div  style="width:100%; padding:30px;" class="w3-col m6">
	  <h3> Combined Heating and Cooling Systems:</h3>
	  <h5>Heat Pumps</h5>
	  <p>Heat pumps are one of the most versitile and energy-efficient systems we offer. Heat pumps heat or cool your home by transferring heat between indoor and outdoor units so they work best in moderate climates like the bay area. Heat pumps can function with or without ducting and will never take up much (if any) space indoors. They can be installed along-side your existing system to maximize energy-efficiency without sacrificing comfort. The models we offer are powered by electricity</p>
		<img style="padding-bottom:30px;" class="w3-image w3-round-large" src="images/heatpump.jpg" alt="Add pictures" width="700" height="394">
      </div>
	  
	  <div  style="width:100%; padding:30px;" class="w3-col m6">
	  <h5>Mini-Splits</h5>
	  <p>Mini-Split systems are the most popular systems on the market for residential and commercial properties. With both heating and cooling capacities, mini-splits are perfect for spaces where individualized climate control is desired. Mini-splits can be installed to heat single rooms/areas (single-zone systems) or heat multiple rooms/areas (multi-zone systems) where the temperature of each room is controlled independently. This system is comprised of a condenser (outdoor unit) and one indoor unit (or multiple units if installing a multi-zone system). Mini splits are usually installed without ducts but can function just as well with ductwork. The mini-splits we offer are powered by electricity and run on refrigerant so they will require occasional maintenance by a certified technician.</p>
		<img style="padding-bottom:30px;" class="w3-image w3-round-large" src="images/minisplit.jpg" alt="Add pictures" width="700" height="394">
      </div>
	  
	  <div  style="width:100%; padding:30px;" class="w3-col m6">
	  <h5>Package Units</h5>
	  <p>Package units, like the name implies, are self-contained heating and cooling systems that combine multiple components in a single unit. Unlike mini-splits, package units rely entirely on ductwork to distribute warm/cold air into your home. These systems do not offer individualized climate control and are more commonly installed in commercial properties or large buildings. Package units are usually installed on the roof of your building or on platforms outside to allow for proper condensate drainage and will require a more thorough maintenance than other systems. These systems can be powered by natural gas* or electricity.</p>
		<img style="padding-bottom:30px;" class="w3-image w3-round-large" src="images/packageunit.jpg" alt="Add pictures" width="700" height="394">
      </div>
	  
	  <div  style="width:100%; padding:30px;" class="w3-col m6">
	  <h3> Ventilation:</h3>
	  <h5>Air Ducts</h5>
	  <p>Ductwork serves as the transportation network for air from your HVAC system. Proper installation is important to prevent air leaks, reduced system efficiency, and uneven temperature distribution. Each ductwork system is comprised of two types of ducting is supply ducts, which deliver conditioned air from your system, and return ducts, which bring air back to your HVAC unit. Depending on your system and building layout, we offer three different types of ducting: flexible ducting, metal ducting, and aluminum ducting</p>
		<img style="padding-bottom:30px;" class="w3-image w3-round-large" src="images/airducts.jpg" alt="Add pictures" width="700" height="394">
      </div>
	  
	  <div  style="width:100%; padding:30px;" class="w3-col m6">
	  <h5>Ductwork Accessories</h5>
	  <p>Some accessories we offer to personalize your ductwork's air distribution are: dampers, registers, grilles, diffusers, sealing materials, flex duct connectors, and collars</p>
		<img style="padding-bottom:30px;" class="w3-image w3-round-large" src="images/ductworkAccessories.jpg" alt="Add pictures" width="700" height="394">
      </div>
	  
	  <div  style="width:100%; padding:30px;" class="w3-col m6">
	  <h3> Thermostats:</h3>
	  <h5>Programmable Thermostats</h5>
	  <p>The most basic and inexpensive of the thermostats we offer is the programmable thermostat. This type of thermostat will take care of all your basic needs but does not offer remote access or learning capabilities. You will be able to customize your home's temperature to your comfort as you desire.</p>
		<img style="padding-bottom:30px;" class="w3-image w3-round-large" src="images/programmablethermostat.jpg" alt="Add pictures" width="700" height="394">
      </div>
	  
	  <div  style="width:100%; padding:30px;" class="w3-col m6">
	  <h5>Smart Thermostats</h5>
	  <p>Smart thermostats are more expensive than programmable thermostats but have additional control over your home's environment. By connecting your smart thermostat to your wi-fi, you will be able to adjust your home's temperature while you are away from home. Some models can integrate with other smart home devices for a comprehensive home automation experience.</p>
		<img style="padding-bottom:30px;" class="w3-image w3-round-large" src="images/smartthermostat.jpg" alt="Add pictures" width="700" height="394">
      </div>
	  
	  <div  style="width:100%; padding:30px;" class="w3-col m6">
	  <h5>Zoning Control Systems</h5>
	  <p>Zoning control systems divide your home/building into seperate zones, each with its own thermostat and independent temperature control. This allows for different areas of your home/building to be heated or cooled based on specific needs. Zoning control systems can be integrated with programmable/smart thermostats as desired.</p>
		<img style="padding-bottom:30px;" class="w3-image w3-round-large" src="images/zonecontrol.jpg" alt="Add pictures" width="700" height="394">
      </div>
	  
	  <div  style="width:100%; padding:30px;" class="w3-col m6">
	  <h3> Maintenance Products:</h3>
	  <h5>Filters</h5>
	  <p>Filters play a crucial role in maintaining the efficiency of your HVAC system. They trap airborne particles (duct, pollen, mold spores, pet hair, etc) and prevent it from being recirculated throughout your home. They keep your system clean of contaminents, and extend your system's lifespan. Filters should changed once every three months (or more often if you have pets) to keep your system running smoothly. </p>
		<img style="padding-bottom:30px;" class="w3-image w3-round-large" src="images/filters.jpg" alt="Add pictures" width="700" height="394">
	  </div>
	  
	  <div  style="width:100%; padding:30px;" class="w3-col m6">
	  <h5>System Cleaning Solutions</h5>
	  <p>We use a variety of cleaning solutions when we service your systems. Depending on the system, we will use cleaning solutions to clean your system's evaporator coil, condenser coil, air ducts, air filters, drain line, condensate pan, blower fan, humidifier pad, and other components. Using harsh or inappropriate chemicals can damage your system or compromise your system's performance.</p>
		<img style="padding-bottom:30px;" class="w3-image w3-round-large" src="images/cleaner.jpg" alt="Add pictures" width="700" height="394">
	  </div>
	  
	  <div  style="width:100%; padding:30px;" class="w3-col m6">
