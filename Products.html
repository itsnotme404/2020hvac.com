		<!--<h4>Wall Furnace</h4>
		<p>
		Wall furnaces (also known as wall heaters) are compact units designed to heat specific rooms/areas
		in your home. They are installed directly on a wall and require some space to allow for proper 
		ventilation. We commonly install wall furnaces powered by natural gas* or electricity. We offer both 
		single-sided units (heats one room/area) or double-sided units (heats two adjacent rooms/areas).
		</p>-->
		
		
		
		
		<h3>Cooling Systems</h3>
		
		<div class="centralCooling">
		<h4>Central Air Conditioners</h4>
		<p>
		Central air conditioners are designed to cool your entire home by distributing cold air through air ducts.
		These systems have an inside unit (installed alongside your furnace) and outside unit. The inside 
		unit pulls warm air from your home while the outside unit uses refrigerant to pump cool air back into your
		home. The most common central air conditioners we install are powered by electricity.
		</p>
		</div>
		
		<!--<h4>Through-the-wall Air Conditioners</h4>
		<p>
		Through-the-wall air conditioners are compact units designed to cool specific rooms/areas in your home.
		Like their name implies, these units are installed inside your home through to an exterior wall. These 
		systems are comprised of an indoor evaporator unit and an outdoor condenser unit with a wall sleeve in 
		between to insulate your home. These systems are powered by electricity and function more efficiently 
		than window-mounted A/C's.
		</p>-->
		
		
		
		
		
		<h3>Combined Heating and Cooling Systems</h3>
		
		<h4>Heat Pumps</h4>
		<p>
		Heat pumps are one of the most versitile and energy-efficient systems we offer. Heat pumps heat or cool
		your home by transferring heat between indoor and outdoor units so they work best in moderate climates
		like the bay area. Heat pumps can function with or without ducting and will never take up much (if any) space 
		indoors. They can be installed along-side your existing system to maximize energy-efficiency without 
		sacrificing comfort. The models we offer are powered by electricity.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Mini-Splits</h4>
		<p>
		Mini-Split systems are the most popular systems on the market for residential and commercial properties. 
		With both heating and cooling capacities, mini-splits are perfect for spaces where individualized climate
		control is desired. Mini-splits can be installed to heat single rooms/areas (single-zone systems) or heat
		multiple rooms/areas (multi-zone systems) where the temperature of each room is controlled independently. 
		This system is comprised of a condenser (outdoor unit) and one indoor unit (or multiple units if installing
		a multi-zone system). Mini splits are usually installed without ducts but can function just as well 
		with ductwork. The mini-splits we offer are powered by electricity and run on refrigerant so they will
		require occasional maintenance by a certified technician.
0		</p>
		
		<h4>Package Units</h4>
		<p>
		Package units, like the name implies, are self-contained heating and cooling systems that combine multiple
		components in a single unit. Unlike mini-splits, package units rely entirely on ductwork to distribute
		warm/cold air into your home. These systems do not offer individualized climate control and are more commonly
		installed in commercial properties or large buildings. Package units are usually installed on the roof of your building or on platforms
		outside to allow for proper condensate drainage and will require a more thorough maintenance than other
		systems. These systems can be powered by natural gas* or electricity.

		<h3>Ventilation</h3>
		
		<h4>Air Ducts</h4>
		<p>
		Ductwork serves as the transportation network for air from your HVAC system. Proper installation
		is important to prevent air leaks, reduced system efficiency, and uneven temperature distribution. 
		Each ductwork system is comprised of two types of ducting is supply ducts, which deliver 
		conditioned air from your system, and return ducts, which bring air back to your HVAC unit. 
		Depending on your system and building layout, we offer three different types of ducting: 
		flexible ducting, metal ducting, and aluminum ducting.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Ductwork Accessories</h4>
		
		<p>
		Some accessories we offer to personalize your ductwork's air distribution are:
		dampers, registers, grilles, diffusers, sealing materials, flex duct connectors, and collars.
		</p>
		
		
		
		
		
		<h3>Thermostats</h3>
		
		<h4>Programmable Thermostats</h4>
		<p>
		The most basic and inexpensive of the thermostats we offer is the programmable thermostat. This type
		of thermostat will take care of all your basic needs but does not offer remote access or learning capabilities.
		You will be able to customize your home's temperature to your comfort as you desire.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Smart Thermostats</h4>
		<p>
		Smart thermostats are more expensive than programmable thermostats but have additional control over your
		home's environment. By connecting your smart thermostat to your wi-fi, you will be able to adjust your home's
		temperature while you are away from home. Some models can integrate with other smart home devices for a comprehensive
		home automation experience.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Zoning Control Systems</h4>
		<p>
		Zoning control systems divide your home/building into seperate zones, each with its own thermostat and 
		independent temperature control. This allows for different areas of your home/building to be heated or
		cooled based on specific needs. Zoning control systems can be integrated with programmable/smart thermostats
		as desired.
		</p>
		
		
		
		<h3>Maintenance Products</h3>
		
		<h4>Filters</h4>
		<p>
		Filters play a crucial role in maintaining the efficiency of your HVAC system. They trap airborne
		particles (duct, pollen, mold spores, pet hair, etc) and prevent it from being recirculated throughout 
		your home. They keep your system clean of contaminents, and extend your system's lifespan. Filters should
		changed once every three months (or more often if you have pets) to keep your system running smoothly.
		</p>
		
		<h4>System Cleaning Solutions</h4>
		<p>
		We use a variety of cleaning solutions when we service your systems. Depending on the system, we will
		use cleaning solutions to clean your system's evaporator coil, condenser coil, air ducts, air filters,
		drain line, condensate pan, blower fan, humidifier pad, and other components. Using harsh or inappropriate
		chemicals can damage your system or compromise your system's performance. 
		</p>
		
		<h4>Refrigerant</h4>
		<p>
		Because most refrigerant has a negative effect on the environment, only technicians with an EPA 608 
		Type II license should handle this substance.  Most HVAC systems use refrigerant of some kind to
		cool and absorb heat efficiently.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Repair Accessories</h4>
		<p>
		Each system is different and requires different parts to function, here are some of the most
		commonly replaced components we deal with:
		capacitor, flame sensor, control board, sling switch, inducer motor, gas pump, temperature sensor, 
		switch pressure, and fans.
		
		
		<!--side note about natural gas appliance bans!-->
		<p>*As California moves to ban natural gas appliances, maintenance/repairs/installation of gas-reliant
		systems may not be possible.</p>
